Have you ever wondered what Dagger does under the hood ü§î?

Every annotation has a *point* üîç! Check out these cheat sheets to understand how Dagger interprets them and the code it generates for you. Explanations about the generated code and Dagger annotations can be found in the cheat sheets as comments.

For more information about dependency injection, why you might use Dagger in your Android app, and how to use it, check out the official Android documentation: [https://d.android.com/dependency-injection](https://d.android.com/dependency-injection).

If you prefer a step-by-step learning process, check out the [Using Dagger in your Android app codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-dagger/).
