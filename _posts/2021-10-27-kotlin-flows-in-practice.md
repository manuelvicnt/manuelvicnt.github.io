Kotlin Flows in practice — Android Dev Summit 2021 talk

## Description 

With coroutines as the recommended solution for asynchronous operations, Kotlin Flow is the obvious choice for managing streams of data in Android apps. However, there are some lifecycle perils to consider and new lifecycle-aware APIs to understand in order to get the most out of Flows in Android. Learn about the powerful and expressive Flow APIs and how to use them across all layers of your app in a practical way—solving common use cases every developer can face.

Speakers: Manuel Vicente Vivo, Jose Alcérreca
