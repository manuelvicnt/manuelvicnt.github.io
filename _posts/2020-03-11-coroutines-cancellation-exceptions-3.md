All you need to know about exceptions in coroutines

We, developers, usually spend a lot of time polishing the happy path of our app. However, it‚Äôs equally important to provide a proper user experience whenever things don‚Äôt go as expected. On one hand, seeing an application crash is a bad experience for the user; on the other hand, showing the right message to the user when an action didn‚Äôt succeed is indispensable.

Handling exceptions properly has a huge impact on how users perceive your application. In this article, we‚Äôll explain how exceptions are propagated in coroutines and how you can always be in control, including the different ways to handle them.

## A coroutine suddenly failed! What now? üò±

When a coroutine fails with an exception, it will propagate said exception up to its parent! Then, the parent will 1) cancel the rest of its children, 2) cancel itself and 3) propagate the exception up to its parent.

The exception will reach the root of the hierarchy and all the coroutines that the `CoroutineScope` started will get cancelled too.

</p>

While propagating an exception can make sense in some cases, there are other cases when that‚Äôs undesirable. Imagine a UI-related `CoroutineScope` that processes user interactions. If a child coroutine throws an exception, the UI scope will be cancelled and the whole UI component will become unresponsive as a cancelled scope cannot start more coroutines.

What if you don‚Äôt want that behavior? Alternatively, you can use a different implementation of `Job`, namely `SupervisorJob`, in the `CoroutineContext` of the `CoroutineScope` that creates these coroutines.

### SupervisorJob to the rescue

With a [`SupervisorJob`](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-supervisor-job.html), the failure of a child doesn‚Äôt affect other children. A `SupervisorJob` won‚Äôt cancel itself or the rest of its children. Moreover, `SupervisorJob` won‚Äôt propagate the exception either, and will let the child coroutine handle it.

You can create a `CoroutineScope` like this `val uiScope = CoroutineScope(SupervisorJob())` to not propagate cancellation when a coroutine fails as this image depicts:

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/2020-03-11-coroutines-cancellation-exceptions-3_2.png">
  <small>A SupervisorJob won‚Äôt cancel itself or the rest of its children</small>
</p>

If the exception is not handled and the `CoroutineContext` doesn‚Äôt have a [`CoroutineExceptionHandler`](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-coroutine-exception-handler/index.html) (as we‚Äôll see later), it will reach the default thread‚Äôs `ExceptionHandler`. In the JVM, the exception will be logged to console; and in Android, it will make your app crash regardless of the Dispatcher this happens on.

> üí• Uncaught exceptions will always be thrown regardless of the kind of Job you use

The same behavior applies to the scope builders [`coroutineScope`](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/coroutine-scope.html) and [`supervisorScope`](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/supervisor-scope.html). These will create a sub-scope (with a `Job` or a `SupervisorJob` accordingly as a parent) with which you can logically group coroutines (e.g. if you want to do parallel computations or you want them to be or not be affected by each other).

***Warning***: A `SupervisorJob` **only** works as described when it‚Äôs part of a scope: either created using [`supervisorScope`](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/supervisor-scope.html) or `CoroutineScope(SupervisorJob())`.

### Job or SupervisorJob? ü§î

When should you use a `Job` or a `SupervisorJob`? Use a `SupervisorJob` or `supervisorScope` when you don‚Äôt want a failure to cancel the parent and siblings.

Some examples:

```kotlin
// Scope handling coroutines for a particular layer of my app
val scope = CoroutineScope(SupervisorJob())

scope.launch {
    // Child 1
}

scope.launch {
    // Child 2
}
```

In this case, if `child#1` fails, *neither* scope nor `child#2` will be cancelled.

Another example:

```kotlin
// Scope handling coroutines for a particular layer of my app
val scope = CoroutineScope(Job())

scope.launch {
    supervisorScope {
        launch {
            // Child 1
        }
        launch {
            // Child 2
        }
    }
}
```

In this case, as `supervisorScope` creates a sub-scope with a `SupervisorJob`, if `child#1` fails, `child#2` will not be cancelled. If instead you use a `coroutineScope` in the implementation, the failure will get propagated and will end up cancelling scope too.

### Watch out quiz! Who‚Äôs my parent? üéØ

Given the following snippet of code, can you identify what kind of `Job` `child#1` has as a parent?

```kotlin
val scope = CoroutineScope(Job())

scope.launch(SupervisorJob()) {
    // new coroutine -> can suspend
   launch {
        // Child 1
    }
    launch {
        // Child 2
    }
}
```

`child#1`‚Äôs parentJob is of type Job! Hope you got it right! Even though at first impression, you might‚Äôve thought that it can be a `SupervisorJob`, it is not because a new coroutine always gets assigned a new `Job()` which in this case overrides the `SupervisorJob`. `SupervisorJob` is the parent of the coroutine created with `scope.launch`; so literally, `SupervisorJob` does nothing in that code!

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/2020-03-11-coroutines-cancellation-exceptions-3_3.png">
  <small>The parent of `child#1` and `child#2` is of type `Job`, not `SupervisorJob`</small>
</p>

Therefore, if either `child#1` or `child#2` fails, the failure will reach scope and all work started by that scope will be cancelled.

Remember that a `SupervisorJob` **only** works as described when it‚Äôs part of a scope: either created using [`supervisorScope`](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/supervisor-scope.html) or `CoroutineScope(SupervisorJob())`. Passing a `SupervisorJob` as a parameter of a coroutine builder will not have the desired effect you would‚Äôve thought for cancellation.

Regarding exceptions, if any child throws an exception, that `SupervisorJob` won‚Äôt propagate the exception up in the hierarchy and will let its coroutine handle it.

### Under the hood

If you‚Äôre curious about how `Job` works under the hood, check out the implementation of the functions [`childCancelled`](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/blob/master/kotlinx-coroutines-core/common/src/JobSupport.kt#L645) and [`notifyCancelling`](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/blob/master/kotlinx-coroutines-core/common/src/JobSupport.kt#L326) in the `JobSupport.kt` file.

In the `SupervisorJob` implementation, the [`childCancelled`](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/blob/master/kotlinx-coroutines-core/common/src/Supervisor.kt#L64) method just returns `false`, meaning that it doesn‚Äôt propagate cancellation but it doesn‚Äôt handle the exception either.

## Dealing with Exceptions üë©‚Äçüöí

Coroutines use the regular Kotlin syntax for handling exceptions: `try/catch` or built-in helper functions like [`runCatching`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/run-catching.html) (which uses `try/catch` internally).

We said before that **uncaught exceptions will always be thrown**. However, different coroutines builders treat exceptions in different ways.

### Launch

With launch, **exceptions will be thrown as soon as they happen**. Therefore, you can wrap the code that can throw exceptions inside a `try/catch`, like in this example:

```kotlin
scope.launch {
    try {
        codeThatCanThrowExceptions()
    } catch(e: Exception) {
        // Handle exception
    }
}
```

> With `launch`, exceptions will be thrown as soon as they happen.

### Async

When `async` is used as a root coroutine (coroutines that are a direct child of a `CoroutineScope` instance or `supervisorScope`), **exceptions are not thrown automatically, instead, they‚Äôre thrown when you call `.await()`**.

To handle exceptions thrown in `async` whenever it‚Äôs a root coroutine, you can wrap the `.await()` call inside a `try/catch`:

```kotlin
supervisorScope {
    val deferred = async {
        codeThatCanThrowExceptions()
    }
    
    try {
        deferred.await()
    } catch(e: Exception) {
        // Handle exception thrown in async
    }
}
```

In this case, notice that calling `async` will *never* throw the exception, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs not necessary to wrap it as well. `await` will throw the exception that happened inside the `async` coroutine.

> When `async` is used as a root coroutine, exceptions are thrown when you call `.await()`

Also, notice that we‚Äôre using a `supervisorScope` to call `async` and `await`. As we said before, a `SupervisorJob` lets the coroutine handle the exception; as opposed to `Job` that will automatically propagate it up in the hierarchy so the `catch` block won‚Äôt be called:

```kotlin
coroutineScope {
    try {
        val deferred = async {
            codeThatCanThrowExceptions()
        }
        deferred.await()
    } catch(e: Exception) {
        // Exception thrown in async WILL NOT be caught here 
        // but propagated up to the scope
    }
}
```

Furthermore, exceptions that happen in coroutines created by other coroutines will always be propagated regardless of the coroutine builder. For example:

```kotlin
val scope = CoroutineScope(Job())

scope.launch {
    async {
        // If async throws, launch throws without calling .await()
    }
}
```

In this case, if `async` throws an exception, it will get thrown as soon as it happens because the coroutine that is the direct child of the scope is `launch`. The reason is that `async` (with a `Job` in its `CoroutineContext`) will automatically propagate the exception up to its parent (`launch`) that will throw the exception.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Exceptions thrown in a `coroutineScope` builder or in coroutines created by other coroutines won‚Äôt be caught in a try/catch!

In the `SupervisorJob` section, we mention the existence of `CoroutineExceptionHandler`. Let‚Äôs dive into it!

### CoroutineExceptionHandler

The `CoroutineExceptionHandler` is an optional element of a `CoroutineContext` allowing you to **handle uncaught exceptions**.

Here‚Äôs how you can define a `CoroutineExceptionHandler`, whenever an exception is caught, you have information about the `CoroutineContext` where the exception happened and the exception itself:

```kotlin
val handler = CoroutineExceptionHandler {
    context, exception -> println("Caught $exception")
}
```

Exceptions will be caught if these requirements are met:

* **When** ‚è∞: The exception is thrown by a coroutine that *automatically* throws exceptions (works with `launch`, not with `async`).

* **Where** üåç: If it‚Äôs in the `CoroutineContext` of a `CoroutineScope` or a root coroutine (direct child of `CoroutineScope` or a `supervisorScope`).

Let‚Äôs see some examples using the `CoroutineExceptionHandler` defined above. In the following example, the exception will be caught by the handler:

```kotlin
val scope = CoroutineScope(Job())
scope.launch(handler) {
    launch {
        throw Exception("Failed coroutine")
    }
}
```

In this other case in which the handler is installed in a inner coroutine, it *won‚Äôt* be caught:

```kotlin
val scope = CoroutineScope(Job())
scope.launch {
    launch(handler) {
        throw Exception("Failed coroutine")
    }
}
```

The exception isn‚Äôt caught because the handler is not installed in the right `CoroutineContext`. The inner launch will propagate the exception up to the parent as soon as it happens, since the parent doesn‚Äôt know anything about the handler, the exception will be thrown.

---

Dealing with exceptions gracefully in your application is important to have a good user experience, even when things don‚Äôt go as expected.

Remember to use `SupervisorJob` when you want to avoid propagating cancellation when an exception happens, and Job otherwise.

Uncaught exceptions will be propagated, catch them to provide a great UX!
