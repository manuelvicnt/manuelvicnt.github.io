Using Jetpack libraries in Compose - Google I/O 2021 talk.

## Description 

Jetpack Compose integrates seamlessly with other Jetpack libraries. There's no need to rewrite everything from scratch to start using Compose in your app. The UI code might change, but the rest of your app architecture remains intact. In this Session, we add Compose to an existing app that already uses ViewModel, LiveData/Flow, Paging, Room, Hilt, and Navigation! Learn how the libraries work with Compose, when to use ViewModels, and how to get the most out of Navigation Compose.

Speakers: Ian Lake, Manuel Vicente Vivo
