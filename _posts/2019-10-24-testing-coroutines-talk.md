How to test coroutines in 2019!

### Abstract

Coroutines simplify the way we do async programming on Android. However, testing async code has never been an easy task. In this talk, we show you how to master testing asynchronicity with coroutines to get that precious green check ✔️. Which questions do you have to ask yourself before writing a line of test code? How can you test coroutines that use Dispatchers.Main? What if you want to control the timing of your events? Why shouldn't you use Dispatchers.Unconfined? Come and learn how to test coroutines like a pro.
