Best practices for work that needs to run beyond its current scope with an applicationScope!

In [part 2 of the Cancellation and Exceptions in Coroutines series](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/cancellation-in-coroutines-aa6b90163629), we learnt the importance of cancelling work when it‚Äôs no longer needed. On Android, you can use the `CoroutineScopes` provided by Jetpack: `viewModelScope` or `lifecycleScope` that cancel any running work when their scope completes ‚Äî that is when the `Activity/Fragment/Lifecycle` completes. If you‚Äôre creating your own `CoroutineScope`, make sure you tie it to a `Job` and call cancel when needed.

However, there are cases when you want an operation to complete even if the user navigated away from a screen. As such, you *don‚Äôt* want the work to be cancelled (e.g. writing to a database or making a certain network request to your server).

Keep reading for a pattern to achieve this!

## Coroutines or WorkManager?

Coroutines will run as long as your application process is alive. If you need to run operations that should outlive the process (e.g. sending logs to your remote server), use [WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager) instead on Android. WorkManager is the library to use for critical operations that are expected to execute at some point in the future.

Use coroutines for operations that are valid in the current process and can be cancelled if the user kills the app (e.g. making a network request you want to cache). What‚Äôs the pattern to trigger these operations?

## Coroutines best practices

Since this pattern builds upon other coroutine best practices; let‚Äôs recap them:

### 1. Inject Dispatchers into classes

Don‚Äôt hardcode them when creating new coroutines or calling `withContext`.

‚úÖ Benefits: ease of testing as you can easily replace them for both unit and instrumentation tests.

### 2. The ViewModel/Presenter layer should create coroutines

If it‚Äôs a UI-only operation, then the UI layer can do it. If you think this is not possible in your project, it‚Äôs likely you‚Äôre not following best practice #1 (i.e. it‚Äôs more difficult to test VMs that don‚Äôt inject `Dispatchers`; in that case exposing suspend functions makes it doable).

‚úÖ Benefits: The UI layer should be dumb and not directly trigger any business logic. Instead, defer that responsibility to the ViewModel/Presenter layer. Testing the UI layer requires instrumentation tests in Android which need an emulator to run.

### 3. The layers below the ViewModel/Presenter layer should expose suspend functions and Flows

If you need to create coroutines, use [`coroutineScope`](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/coroutine-scope.html) or [`supervisorScope`](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/supervisor-scope.html). If you need them to follow a different scope, this is what this article is about! Keep reading!

‚úÖ Benefits: The caller (generally the ViewModel layer) can control the execution and lifecycle of the work happening in those layers, being able to cancel when needed.

## Operations that shouldn‚Äôt be cancelled in Coroutines

Imagine we have a ViewModel and a Repository in our app with the following logic:

```kotlin
class MyViewModel(private val repo: Repository) : ViewModel() {
  fun callRepo() {
    viewModelScope.launch {
      repo.doWork()
    }
  }
}

class Repository(private val ioDispatcher: CoroutineDispatcher) {
  suspend fun doWork() {
    withContext(ioDispatcher) {
      doSomeOtherWork()
      veryImportantOperation() // This shouldn‚Äôt be cancelled
    }
  }
}
```

We don‚Äôt want `veryImportantOperation()` to be controlled by `viewModelScope` as it could be cancelled at any point. We want that operation to outlive `viewModelScope`. How can we achieve that?

To do this, **create your own scope in the Application class and call those operations in coroutines started by it**. That scope should be injected in the classes that need it.

The benefits of creating your own `CoroutineScope` vs other solutions we‚Äôll see later (like `GlobalScope`) is that you can configure it as you wish. Do you need a [`CoroutineExceptionHandler`](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-coroutine-exception-handler/)? Do you have your own thread pool you use as a `Dispatcher`? Place all that common configuration there in its `CoroutineContext`!

You can call it `applicationScope` and it must contain a `SupervisorJob()` so that failures in coroutines don‚Äôt propagate in the hierarchy (as seen in [part 3 of the series](https://manuelvivo.dev/coroutines-cancellation-exceptions-3)):

```kotlin
class MyApplication : Application() {
  // No need to cancel this scope as it'll be torn down with the process
  val applicationScope = CoroutineScope(SupervisorJob() + otherConfig)
}
```

We don‚Äôt need to cancel this scope since we want it to remain active as long as the application process is alive, so we don‚Äôt hold a reference to the `SupervisorJob`. We can use this scope to run coroutines that need a longer lifetime than the calling scope might offer in our app.

> For operations that shouldn‚Äôt be cancelled, call them from a coroutine created by an application CoroutineScope

**Whenever you create a new Repository instance, pass in the applicationScope we created above**. For tests, check out the *Testing* section below.

### Which coroutine builder to use?

Depending on `veryImportantOperation`‚Äôs behavior, you‚Äôd need to start a new coroutine using either launch or async:

* If it needs to return a result, use **`async`** and call **`await`** to wait for it to finish.

* If not, use **`launch`** and wait for it to finish with **`join`**. Note that as explained in [part 3 of the series](https://manuelvivo.dev/coroutines-cancellation-exceptions-3), you have to handle exceptions manually inside the launch block.

This is how you‚Äôd trigger the coroutine using `launch`:

```kotlin
class Repository(
  private val externalScope: CoroutineScope,
  private val ioDispatcher: CoroutineDispatcher
) {
  suspend fun doWork() {
    withContext(ioDispatcher) {
      doSomeOtherWork()
      externalScope.launch {
        // if this can throw an exception, wrap inside try/catch
        // or rely on a CoroutineExceptionHandler installed
        // in the externalScope's CoroutineScope
        veryImportantOperation()
      }.join()
    }
  }
}
```

or using `async`:

```kotlin
class Repository(
  private val externalScope: CoroutineScope,
  private val ioDispatcher: CoroutineDispatcher
) {
  suspend fun doWork(): Any { // Use a specific type in Result
    withContext(ioDispatcher) {
      doSomeOtherWork()
      return externalScope.async {
        // Exceptions are exposed when calling await, they will be
        // propagated in the coroutine that called doWork. Watch
        // out! They will be ignored if the calling context cancels.
        veryImportantOperation()
      }.await()
    }
  }
}
```

In any case, the ViewModel code doesn‚Äôt change and with the above, even if the `viewModelScope` gets destroyed, the work using `externalScope` will keep running. Furthermore, `doWork()` won‚Äôt return until `veryImportantOperation()` completes as with any other suspend call.

### What about something simpler?

Another pattern that could serve some use cases (and it‚Äôs probably the first solution anyone would come up with) is wrapping `veryImportantOperation` in the `externalScope`‚Äôs context using `withContext` as follows:

```kotlin
class Repository(
  private val externalScope: CoroutineScope,
  private val ioDispatcher: CoroutineDispatcher
) {
  suspend fun doWork() {
    withContext(ioDispatcher) {
      doSomeOtherWork()
      withContext(externalScope.coroutineContext) {
        veryImportantOperation()
      }
    }
  }
}
```

However, this approach has some caveats that you should be aware of:

* If the coroutine that calls `doWork` is cancelled while `veryImportantOperation` is getting executed, the coroutine will keep executing until the next cancellation point, not after `veryImportantOperation` finishes executing.

* `CoroutineExceptionHandler`s don‚Äôt work as you‚Äôd expect when the context is used in `withContext` since the exception will be re-thrown.

## Testing

As we‚Äôll need to inject both `Dispatchers` and `CoroutineScope`s, what should you inject in those cases?

<small>What to inject in testing</small>

üîñ Legend: [`TestCoroutineDispatcher`](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-test/kotlinx.coroutines.test/-test-coroutine-dispatcher/index.html), [`MainCoroutineRule`](https://github.com/android/plaid/blob/master/test_shared/src/main/java/io/plaidapp/test/shared/MainCoroutineRule.kt), [`TestCoroutineScope`](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-test/kotlinx.coroutines.test/-test-coroutine-scope/), [`AsyncTask.THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR.asCoroutineDispatcher()`](https://github.com/google/iosched/blob/adssched/mobile/src/androidTest/java/com/google/samples/apps/iosched/tests/di/TestCoroutinesModule.kt#L36)

## Alternatives

There are other ways to implement this behavior with Coroutines. However, those solutions cannot be applied systematically in all use cases. Let‚Äôs see some alternatives and why/when you should/shouldn‚Äôt use them.

### ‚ùå GlobalScope

There are multiple reasons why you shouldn‚Äôt use [`GlobalScope`](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-global-scope/):

* **Promotes hard-coding values**. It might be tempting to hardcode `Dispatchers` if you use `GlobalScope` straight-away. That‚Äôs a bad practice!

* **It makes testing very hard**. As your code is going to be executed in an uncontrolled scope, you won‚Äôt be able to manage execution of work started by it.

* **You can‚Äôt have a common CoroutineContext for all coroutines** built into the scope as we did with the `applicationScope`. Instead, you‚Äôd have to pass a common `CoroutineContext` to all coroutines started by `GlobalScope`.

**Recommendation: Don‚Äôt use it directly.**

### ‚ùå ProcessLifecycleOwner scope in Android

In Android, there‚Äôs an `applicationScope` available in the `androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-process` library, accessed with `ProcessLifecycleOwner.get().lifecycleScope`.

In this case, you‚Äôd inject a `LifecycleOwner` instead of a `CoroutineScope` as we did before. In production, you‚Äôd pass in `ProcessLifecycleOwner.get()` and in unit tests, you can create a fake `LifecycleOwner` using `LifecycleRegistry`.

Notice that the default `CoroutineContext` of this scope uses `Dispatchers.Main.immediate` which might not be desirable for background work. As with `GlobalScope`, you‚Äôd have to pass a common `CoroutineContext` to all coroutines started by it.

Because of all the above, this alternative requires more work than just creating a `CoroutineScope` in the `Application` class. Also, I don‚Äôt personally like having classes related to the Android lifecycle in layers below the ViewModel/Presenter as these layers should be platform agnostic.

**Recommendation: Don‚Äôt use it directly.**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

If it turns out that the `CoroutineContext` of your `applicationScope` matches the `GlobalScope` or `ProcessLifecycleOwner.get().lifecycleScope` one, you can directly assign them as follows:

```kotlin
class MyApplication : Application() {
  val applicationScope = GlobalScope
}
```

You still get all the *benefits* mentioned above and you can easily change it if needed in the future.

### ‚ùå ‚úÖ Using NonCancellable

As seen in [part 2 of the series](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/cancellation-in-coroutines-aa6b90163629), you can use `withContext(NonCancellable)` to be able to call suspend functions in a cancelled coroutine. We suggested using it to perform cleanup code that can suspend. However, you shouldn‚Äôt abuse it.

Doing this is very risky as you lose control of the execution of the coroutine. It‚Äôs true that it produces more concise and easier to read code but the problems this can cause in the future are unpredictable.

Example of its usage:

```kotlin
class Repository(
  private val ioDispatcher: CoroutineDispatcher
) {
  suspend fun doWork() {
    withContext(ioDispatcher) {
      doSomeOtherWork()
      withContext(NonCancellable) {
        veryImportantOperation()
      }
    }
  }
}
```

As very tempting as it can be to do, you might not always know what‚Äôs behind `veryImportantOperation()`: maybe it‚Äôs an external library, maybe the implementation is behind an interface,... What problems can happen?

* You won‚Äôt be able to stop those operations in tests.

* An endless loop that uses delay won‚Äôt be able to cancel anymore.

* Collecting a Flow within it makes the Flow non-cancellable from the outside.

* ...

These problems can lead to subtle and very hard to debug bugs.

**Recommendation: use it ONLY for suspending cleanup code.**

---

Whenever you need some work to run beyond its current scope, we recommend creating a custom scope in your `Application` class and running coroutines within it. Avoid using `GlobalScope`, `ProcessLifecycleOwner` scope and `NonCancellable` for this type of work.
