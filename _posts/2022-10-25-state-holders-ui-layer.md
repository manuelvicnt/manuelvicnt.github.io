Android Dev Summit 2022 talk

## Description 

The UI layer displays application data on the screen. But how is it done exactly? We dive deep into the UI state production pipeline and state holders that manage UI complexity. Get to know the differences between UI and business logic, a ViewModel and a plain state holder class, state and events, and more! What is all that, when to use which, and how to do it.
