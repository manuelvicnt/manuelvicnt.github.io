A Compose State of Mind â€” Android Dev Summit 2021 talk

## Description 

Jetpack Compose offers automatic state observation that recomposes or recreates your UI whenever state changes. Learn about Compose's state model and the Composition, when to hoist state and create state holders or use AAC ViewModels, and how to mutate state when you're outside the Composition safely so that these changes are tracked by Compose.
