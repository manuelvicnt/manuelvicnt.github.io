Get more flexibility in Hilt by adding your own components to the hierarchy

Inserting a component in the middle of the Hilt component hierarchy is not possible. However, you can create a custom component with a Hilt component as a parent and access its scoped types using entry points. In the article, we‚Äôll see what all this implies and how to add a custom component in the *Dagger 2 codelab* code.

The [Dagger 2 codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-dagger/) goes through adding Dagger to a multiple-Activity application. As the user can log in and out of the app, user information is handled in a Dagger component with a lifespan longer than activity components.

In the diagram above, notice how `MainActivity` and `SettingsActivity` access the `UserComponent` with `UserDataRepository` scoped to it. The in-memory `UserDataRepository` handles information related to a logged-in user. When the user logs out, we want to remove the info from memory.

In Hilt and Dagger, every component must be held by an object (you can think of it as a lifecycle owner) that knows when the component needs to be created or destroyed. In our example, that class is `UserManager` that keeps track of logins and logouts. When the user logs in, a new component is created and when the user logs out, the component is destroyed. In that way, `MainActivity` and `SettingsActivity` can access the same instance of the component to get injected by it.

All components of this app *except* `UserComponent` can be mapped to Hilt‚Äôs standard components: `AppComponent` maps to Hilt‚Äôs `ApplicationComponent` while `RegistrationComponent` and `LoginComponent` map to `ActivityComponent`.

What can we do to make `UserComponent` more Hilt-friendly? We have different possibilities:

* Scope `UserDataRepository` to the `ApplicationComponent` and handle nullability when the user is logged out. This is what the [Migrating your Dagger app to Hilt codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-dagger-to-hilt/#0) does. Not ideal, but could work in this case. However, it might add some tricky race conditions to deal with on a user switch.

* Make `MainActivity` and `SettingsActivity` fragments, and have the `UserDataRepository` scoped to the activity (Hilt‚Äôs `ActivityRetainedComponent`) where those fragments are used. This is a ‚Äúdoing stuff to fit the framework rather than the framework fitting the use case‚Äù sort of solution. This doesn‚Äôt even work for all situations as you might need to access user information in other places that aren‚Äôt tied to the activity like a broadcast receiver.

* Keep the same navigation structure and add the `UserComponent` to be used by Hilt.

As an exercise to learn more about the flexibility of Hilt, let‚Äôs cover option 3 in this post: adding a component to the Hilt component hierarchy.

## Hilt design decisions

Hilt is opinionated on its component hierarchy as it contains the most common set of components an Android app typically uses. Due to compatibility concerns and Hilt not knowing how to create your component (e.g. what `userId` to use), it‚Äôs not possible to *insert* a component between the layers (e.g. making a custom component X subcomponent of `ApplicationComponent`, and parent of `ActivityRetainedComponent`).

What is possible is *adding* a component to the hierarchy as a leaf component. In our case, we could make our custom component `UserComponent` to be a subcomponent of `ApplicationComponent` as seen in the image.

<small>Adding a subcomponent of ApplicationComponent to the Hilt hierarchy</small>

> The use case in this article consists of adding a custom component (i.e. `UserComponent`) to the hierarchy that has `ApplicationComponent` as a parent. However, as we‚Äôll see later, you can make your custom component extend any Component you want, either a predefined Hilt component or your own other custom one.

The main difference between *inserting* and *adding* a component is that if you insert a component in the hierarchy, its scoped bindings are available in its subcomponents (components below in the hierarchy) whereas if you *add* a component, they won‚Äôt. You could make those scoped bindings flow down (or being available in) the hierarchy if you create your own hierarchy parallel to Hilt‚Äôs one. However, that‚Äôd make you lose the `@AndroidEntryPoint` functionality and you‚Äôd have to use entry points to obtain dependencies in Android framework classes.

As we‚Äôll be adding a component to the hierarchy in our example, we won‚Äôt have `UserDataRepository` (`UserComponent`‚Äôs scoped type) available as a binding in `@AndroidEntryPoint` classes, so we won‚Äôt be able to inject it as any other scoped type:

```kotlin
@Singleton
class AnalyticsRepository @Inject constructor(/*...*/) { /* ... */ }

class MainActivityAnalyticsAdapter @Inject constructor(
  // AnalyticsRepository is available as it's scoped to ApplicationComponent
  analyticsRepository: AnalyticsRepository,

  // üí• Build time error!
  // UserDataRepository is NOT available to Hilt in MainActivity as the binding
  // is not available in ActivityComponent, it's in UserComponent and it's not
  // propagated down the Hilt components hierarchy
  userDataRepository: UserDataRepository
) { /* ... */ }
```

We‚Äôll see later what are the different options to obtain the scoped instance of `UserDataRepository` in our classes.

## Adding a component to the hierarchy

As shown in the [custom components docs](https://dagger.dev/hilt/custom-components), you can declare a component using the `@DefineComponent` annotation.

```kotlin
// Annotation for scoping to UserComponent
@Scope
@MustBeDocumented
@Retention(value = AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME)
annotation class LoggedUserScope

// Types scoped to this component must be annotated with @LoggedUserScope
@LoggedUserScope
// Make UserComponent subcomponent of ApplicationComponent
@DefineComponent(parent = ApplicationComponent::class)
interface UserComponent {

    // Builder to create instances of UserComponent
    @DefineComponent.Builder
    interface Builder {
        fun setUser(@BindsInstance user: User): UserComponent.Builder
        fun build(): UserComponent
    }
}
```

We made `UserComponent` a subcomponent of `ApplicationComponent` as specified in the parent parameter of the `@DefineComponent` annotation. Additionally, we created the `@LoggedUserScope` to be able to scope types to `UserComponent`. Use the builder annotated with `@DefineComponent.Builder` to create instances of `UserComponent`, as you‚Äôll see later, this is what `UserManager` will be using.

> Use `@DefineComponent` to define a new custom component you can use in your app. It takes in the parent component as a parameter. The new component will extend the parent component meaning that all parent bindings will be available in the new component. Because of our the specific use case for this blog post, we used Hilt‚Äôs `ApplicationComponent`, however, you can make it extend any component you want: it could be a Hilt component or any other custom component you already have defined.

With this, we can scope types to this component already:

```kotlin
@LoggedUserScope
class UserDataRepository @Inject constructor(/*...*/) {/* ... */}
```

## Managing the lifecycle of the component

A class scoped higher up in the components hierarchy should be responsible for the lifecycle of this component. In our case, this class is `UserManager` which is scoped to the `ApplicationComponent`.

As `UserManager` needs to know how to create instances of `UserComponent`, it should receive its builder in the constructor. As `UserComponent` is a subcomponent of `ApplicationComponent`, the builder is available as a binding in there.


```kotlin
@Singleton
class UserManager @Inject constructor(
    // Since UserManager will be in charge of managing the UserComponent's
    // lifecycle, it needs to know how to create instances of it. We use the
    // provider (i.e. factory) Dagger generates for us to create instances of UserComponent.
    private val userComponentProvider: Provider<UserComponent.Builder>
) {

  /**
   *  UserComponent is specific to a logged in user. Holds an instance of
   *  UserComponent. This determines if the user is logged in or not, when the
   *  user logs in, a new Component will be created.
   *  When the user logs out, this will be null.
   */
  var userComponent: UserComponent? = null
      private set

  ...

  private fun userLoggedIn(userId: String) {
    // When the user logs in, we create a new instance of UserComponent
    val user = createUser(userId)
    userComponent = userComponentProvider.get().setUser(user).build()
  }

  private fun logout() {
    // When the user logs out, we remove the instance of UserComponent from memory
    userComponent = null
  }
}
```

## Accessing the scoped bindings

You can access the scoped bindings of `UserComponent` with entry points. For our case, we can create an entry point exposing the `UserDataRepository`:

```kotlin
@InstallIn(UserComponent::class)
@EntryPoint
interface UserComponentEntryPoint {
  fun userDataRepository(): UserDataRepository
}
```

You can access this entry point by using an instance of `UserComponent`:

```kotlin
@AndroidEntryPoint
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

  // Injected by ActivityComponent
  @Inject lateinit var userManager: UserManager

  // Populated by UserComponent
  private lateinit var userDataRepository: UserDataRepository

  override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

    userDataRepository = EntryPoints.get(
      userManager.userComponent, UserComponentEntryPoint::class.java
    ).userDataRepository()

    // Do something with userDataRepository
  }
}
```

## Caveats

There are some caveats to the code we‚Äôve seen so far:

* Scoped types in custom components don‚Äôt flow down the Hilt components hierarchy. That‚Äôs why you need to use entry points and you cannot have it as a dependency of another class unless you use [AssistedInject](https://github.com/square/AssistedInject) as shown in this [example](https://github.com/manuelvicnt/android-dagger-to-hilt/pull/1).

* This is not a full login/user solution as this setup works when the user explicitly logs in and out of the app. If your app allows switching accounts while on the same screen, then you‚Äôd need to manually restart the activity/fragment when that happens. Alternatively, you could add a callback to `UserManager` to know when an account has changed to update the information on the screen accordingly.

Even though inserting a component in the middle of the Hilt component hierarchy is not possible, you can create a component with a Hilt component as a parent and access its scoped types using entry points.
