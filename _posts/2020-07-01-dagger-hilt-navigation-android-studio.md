Easily navigate between Dagger and Hilt related code in Android Studio

> Last update: July 23rd, 2020

Have you ever got lost in a project trying to figure out from where a Dagger or Hilt dependency is being provided? Does it come from an `@Inject` constructor? Or maybe from an `@Binds` or `@Provides` method? Does it have a qualifier? Itâ€™s not an easy taskâ€¦

ðŸ¤” What if you could know that and more with just one click? ðŸŽ¯ Ask no more!

Android Studio 4.1 comes with **new gutter icons that allows you to easily navigate between Dagger-related code**: dependency producers and consumers, components, subcomponents, and modules! Also, you can find the same information in ***Find usages***.

**Hilt support** was added to Android Studio 4.2. Apart from the Dagger features listed above, you can also benefit from easy navigation for **entry points**.

As you can see, navigating the Dagger graph of your Android app has never been easier! Knowing from *exactly* which provider method a dependency is coming is just **one click away** with the new support in Android Studio.

## In action

Starting with Android Studio 4.1 Canary 7, you can see a new gutter icon in projects that use Dagger or Hilt:

</p>

The behavior of these actions are as follows:

* Icon with arrow up -> where the type is provided (i.e. where dependencies come from).

* Tree-shaped icon -> where the type is used as a dependency.

Letâ€™s see some examples of the new functionality using the Dagger branch ([`dev-dagger`](https://github.com/android/architecture-samples/tree/dev-dagger)) of the [architecture-samples GitHub](https://github.com/android/architecture-samples/tree/dev-dagger) sample.

### Knowing where dependencies are coming from

Given a class that can be injected by Dagger, if you tap in the gutter icon with the arrow up of a dependency, youâ€™ll navigate to the method that tells Dagger how to provide that type.

In the following example, `TasksViewModel` has a dependency on `TasksRepository`. Tapping on the gutter icon takes you to the `@Binds` methods in `AppModuleBinds` that provides `TasksRepository`:

### Also works with qualifiers!

Given the above, if the dependency is provided using a qualifier, it will take you to exactly that provider method!

`DefaultTasksRepository` depends on a `TasksDataSource` provided with a qualifier. Tapping on the gutter icon takes you to the method in `AppModule` that provides that type with that qualifier:

### Where is this type being used as a dependency?

When you have a method that tells Dagger how to provide a dependency, you can click the gutter icon with the arrow down to navigate to where that dependency is used. If that dependency is used by more than one consumer, you can select the consumer you want to navigate to from a list.

In our project, `DefaultTasksRepository` is used by different ViewModels. Which ones? You can know it by tapping on the gutter icon of the provider method (`@Binds` in this case):

### Hilt entry points

When youâ€™re at a [Hilt entry point](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android#not-supported), the gutter action helps you navigate to where a dependency is coming from. To showcase this feature, weâ€™ll use the [`interop`](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/android-dagger-to-hilt/tree/interop) branch of the [migrating Dagger to Hilt codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-dagger-to-hilt/).

## Find usages

You can find the same relationships between your Dagger/Hilt code with the *Find usages* feature in Android Studio.

If you right-click on the `bindRepository` of the `AppModuleBinds` class and select ***Find usages***, for example, youâ€™ll see something similar to this:
